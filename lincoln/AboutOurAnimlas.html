                <p class="animalsP">Cows are one of the most familiar and important animals you’ll find on farms all around the world. Known for their gentle nature and curious personalities, cows have been helping humans for thousands of years by providing milk, meat, leather, and even helping with farm work in some parts of the world. 
                    Here at Licoln Farms, cows are a part of the family — and we take great care to make sure they’re healthy, happy, and comfortable.
                    One of the most interesting things about cows is that they have four stomach compartments! This special digestive system allows them to break down tough grasses and plants that many other animals can’t eat. You’ll often see cows lying down in the fields, peacefully chewing their cud — that’s part of their digestion process and a sign they’re content and relaxed.
                    Cows are also very social animals. They form close friendships with each other, recognize familiar faces, and enjoy spending time together as a herd. 
                    Our cows love visitors too, especially if you have a gentle voice or maybe a handful of hay! Whether you’re here to learn, explore, or just enjoy their calming presence, we hope you’ll love meeting our cows as much as we love caring for them.

                <p class="animalsP">Horses have been loyal companions to people for centuries. Known for their strength, beauty, and intelligence, horses have helped humans with travel, work, and even fun. 
                    Here on our farm, our horses are more than just animals — they’re trusted friends, each with their own personality, favorite treats, and special talents.
                    Horses are amazing athletes, with strong muscles, powerful legs, and graceful movements. They can run fast, jump high, and carry riders on adventures through open fields and wooded trails.
                    Even though they’re big and strong, horses are gentle by nature and can form close bonds with people. Many horses love being brushed, petted, and talked to — they even recognize voices and faces over time!
                    Each of our horses has their own story and favorite things. Some love galloping across the pasture, while others enjoy a quiet walk or just munching on fresh hay. 
                    Whether you’re here to meet them for the first time or you’re already a horse lover, we hope you’ll enjoy spending time with our beautiful herd and learning what makes horses such incredible animals.

            <div class="imgs">

                <p class="chickensP"> No farm is complete without a flock of cheerful, clucking chickens! At Lincoln Farms, our chickens are a big part of daily farm life, providing fresh eggs, funny personalities, and lots of entertainment for visitors. They’re curious, busy little creatures, always scratching in the dirt or calling out to their friends.
                    Did you know that chickens can recognize over 100 different faces — including yours? Each one of our hens has her own personality, from shy and sweet to bold and adventurous. And yes, they definitely come running when they hear the food bucket!
                    One of the most exciting things about chickens is their colorful eggs. Depending on the breed, our hens lay beautiful brown, white, and even blue or green eggs! Fresh farm eggs not only look amazing, but they also have rich flavor you won’t find in the store.
                    Next time you visit the farm, be sure to say hello to our flock. You might even get to help collect eggs or feed the chickens! Whether you’re here to learn about farming or just to enjoy the fun of watching a chicken take a dust bath, our coop is always full of surprises.
